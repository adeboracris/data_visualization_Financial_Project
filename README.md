## Introduction
In this project, I have done exploratory data analysis of a financial project. It is based on the ["Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" from John Portilla, at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/).

This projecet'll focus on bank stocks and how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.

 ## Objectives

The objective was to learn and exercise some capabilities of the following Python libraries:
* Pandas
* *Pandas datareader
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
